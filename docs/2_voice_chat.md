> “I want to build something that's a command-line tool that runs the mfluxgenerate command. And it will let you explore different prompts, choose different styles. When you first run it, it'll run a bunch of variations on it, which is just running with a bunch of random seeds. And then when you find a seed that you like, you can be able to run it a whole bunch of more steps with it. So first we start with running just one step, and then when you want to see more, you run 1, 2, 5, whatever, 9, 12 steps as you want.”

Great start! To ensure we're on the same page, can you clarify what kind of output you expect from the `mflux-generate` command? Are we talking about text, images, code, or something else?

> “It should keep track of each run that it does, and it should spit out images primarily, but then also a HTML file or CSS file or something that would let you view those easily on a page.”

Got it! Now, should the tool allow users to specify the number of initial variations and steps, or should it have default values? If so, what would those defaults be?

> “For the variations, the default should be one step for the Schnell model and like five steps for the dev model, and it should be default of four variants, but both of those you should be able to override.”

Got it! Next, do you envision any specific file structure or naming convention for the generated images and HTML/CSS files? If so, what structure would you prefer?

> “It should be, it should, when you run it the first time, it should create a directory or live in that directory and store the prompt and whatever other attributes it needs to in there. And then every time it runs, it should create a new directory called like run underscore one. And inside of that, it should have all the metadata about the files that are in there. And there should be some sort of index HTML file or whatever that you can click on and it will show you all the things. And then on the main page, there should also be some sort of, you know, index file that will help you view it. So you could then start up a live server and just sort of watch it as it goes and click on it to have stuff happen.”

Thanks for detailing that! Now, for the metadata, do you want any specific details included, such as timestamps, model parameters, or user comments?

> “No, if you pass in the dash metadata flag in the mflux generate, it spits out a JSON file, which contains everything that we... I think it's really kind of important to keep track of. It's... Yeah, no, I think that's it.”

Perfect! So, the tool will automatically incorporate the JSON metadata from the `--metadata` flag. Now, do you have any preferences for how users will interact with the tool? For example, should it have a command-line interface with specific commands or options?

> “I think it should be mainly a batch script that you run on the command line.”

Understood! So, we'll build it as a bash script for command-line use. Is there anything else you'd like to add or any particular features you'd like to include?

> “You should be able to specify the...” “resolution of it. So it should be portrait or landscape or square and it should be sort of by default I think it should be you know 124 or 1024 by 1024 and then there should be a landscape version and a portrait version with whatever the appropriate ratios are and then there should be a regular and a large variant.”

Great! With these features in mind, do you have any other requirements or ideas you want to include, or are you ready to move forward with this spec?

> “You know, I think it should be very easy using the tool to, like, select an image that you liked out of the run and then be able to do some variations on it, or you should be able to do it. So it should be just very, it should be very simple to kind of, you know, click in there. Like, the HTML should just have a little thing that shows a command to run, and that should be a very straightforward and simple command.”

Sounds good! This will ensure an easy and user-friendly way to interact with the tool. Anything else you'd like to add, or does that cover everything for now?
